= Welcome to the JSR 364 (JCP.next.4) project =

This is the public project for <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=364"> JSR 364: Broadening JCP Membership </a>. 
This JSR aims to broaden JCP membership and participation by defining new membership classes and changing existing membership categories. The goals are to enable participation by the Java developer community and to ensure the appropriate Intellectual Property (IP) commitments from Members of the JCP program.


As required by JCP 2.9, we will discuss our business in public, publish all of our working materials and meeting minutes, and track issues in the open:

* Subscribe to the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jcpnext4/lists">Observers' mailing-list</a> (you'll need a java.net login) to review and respond to Expert Group communications.

*  Visit the <a href="https://java.net/projects/jcpnext4/forums/message-forum">discussion forum</a> to comment on the work of the Expert Group (we'd prefer that you use this rather than the Observer mailing-list, to keep mail traffic down).

* For our meeting minutes and working documents, visit the <a href="https://github.com/jcp-org/jcpnext4/wiki/DocumentIndex">document archive</a>.

* We use the <a href="https://github.com/jcp-org/jcpnext4/issues">issue tracker</a> to record your comments and track issues. To be informed when new issues are logged and comments are added to existing issues you can <a href = "https://java.net/jira/secure/ViewSubscriptions.jspa?filterId=12146">subscribe directly to the JIRA</a> or alternatively subscribe to the <a href="https://java.net/projects/jcpnext4/lists"> Issues mailing list</a>.

NOTE: there is no need to formally "join" this project in order to participate - everything is visible to those who are not project members, and formal observer status carries no additional privileges.
