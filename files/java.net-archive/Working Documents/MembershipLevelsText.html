<h3>Note: The text below should be inserted as a new section 1.1, before Expert Group Transparency</h3>
<hr />
<h2>1.1 JCP Membership</h2>
<p>In order to enable the broadest possible participation in the work of the JCP several different roles and membership levels have been defined.</p>
<h3>1.1.1 Observer </h3>
<p>Individuals need not sign a formal  JCP Membership Agreement in order to observe and  comment on Expert Group activities since they may take advantage of the JCP's transparency  mechanisms such as public mailing lists and Issue Trackers. (Typically, however,  Observers will need to register at jcp.org 
and java.net.) Observers are not eligible to join Expert Groups, to run for election to the  the Executive Committee, or to vote in the JCP's annual elections.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 Partner Member</h3>
<p>Non-profit organizations such as Java User Groups that are unwilling or unable (because they are not legal entities) to sign the JSPA may sign a simplified Partner Membership Agreement that focuses on the joint promotion of JCP activities in conjunction with JCP Members and staff. </p>
<p>Partner Members cannot act as a Spec Lead or serve on most Expert Groups but they are eligible to run for election to the Executive Committee. If elected, in their role as Executive Committee members they may serve as members of the Expert Group for JSRs whose focus is redefining the JCP's organization and &quot;constitution&quot; by revising its ruling documents. Partner Members have the same voting rights as Full Members.</p>
<h3>1.1.3  Affiliate Member </h3>
<p>An individual who is unwilling or unable to sign the JSPA may sign an Affiliate Membership Agreement in order to participate  in the activities of the JCP. (Organizations are ineligible for this class of membership.) The Affiliate Membership Agreement is simpler than the JSPA, and involves a  personal IP commitment. No  employer signature is required. </p>
<p>Affiliate Members cannot act as a Spec Lead, join an Expert Group, or run for election to the Executive Committee. They are eligible to vote for  Community 
Executive Committee seats but are not  not eligible to vote for Ratified or Elected seats. At the Spec Leadâ€™s discretion Affiliate members can be formally recognized by being listed as Contributors to a JSR.</p>
<h3>1.1.4 Full Member</h3>
<p>This class of membership is open to corporations, non-profit organizations that are legal entities, 
    self-employed and unemployed individuals, students, and  some employed individuals. The JSPA is the membership agreement for Full Members.</p>
<p>Non-employed individuals and university staff are eligible for Full Membership  if they are legally able to  license their own IP and can therefore sign the JSPA on their own behalf.</p>
<p>Employed individuals are eligible for Full Membership if their employer is not a Full Member and is willing to sign an Employer Contribution Agreement.</p>
<p>Full members may act as a Spec Lead, join an 
    Expert Group, and run for election to any class of seat on the EC. Full members may vote for Nominated and Elected seats on the EC, but not for Community seats.</p>
<h4>1.1.4.1 Member Representative</h4>
<p>Employees and other individuals  who have a contractual relationship with Full Members may be authorized by the Full Member to represent its interests within the JCP by acting as a Spec Lead, serving on an Expert Group, or running for 
the EC. </p>
<p> <span class="Highlight">NOTE: I deliberately didn't cover the <em>One organization, one vote</em> restrictions here since I think they'll be better documented in the Elections section of the Process Document. Let's see.</span></p>
