<h2>Definition changes</h2>
<h3>Deleted definitions</h3>
<p>Note: these deletions have been documented in Issue <a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JCPNEXT4-13">JCPNEXT4-13: The definition of Agent is too broad</a></p>
<p><strong>Member A</strong><strong>ssociate: </strong>An individual who is associated with a Member organization but is not an Agent of that organization.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Agent:</strong> an individual -  for example an employee, a contractor, or an officer - who is  authorized to act on behalf of a company or organization.<br />
  <br />
<strong>Justification for these deletions</strong>: the term Agent is  poorly-defined and unnecessary. The new definition of Member  Representative should be sufficient (and does not use the term Agent).<br />
</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Line 270:</strong> change &quot;Any JCP Member, Member Representative, or Member Associate may request to join an Expert Group&quot; with &quot;Any Full Member or Member Representative may request to join an Expert Group&quot;.<br />
  <strong><br />
  </strong><strong>Lines 278-9:</strong> change &quot;together with the names of individual Member Representatives or Member Associates where appropriate&quot; to &quot;together with the names of individual Member Representatives where appropriate&quot;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Note:</strong> the term Agent is also used on lines 275 and lines 728, but those  sections should be modified when the new election processes are  documented. At that point the term Agent should not be necessary and  should be removed or replaced.<strong><br />
