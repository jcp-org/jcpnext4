<h2>Notes on Exhibit B  (v 1.2)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Version 1.2 of this document differs from 1.1 by noting a proposed change with respect to Essential Patents suggested by the <a href="https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf">IP-flow document</a>. Taking this change into account brings the proposal closer to the views expressed by several members at a recent Working Group meeting that the new Exhibit B should be as similar as possible (perhaps identical) to the JSPA.</p>
<h3>The current JSPA</h3>
<p>The current JSPA says that with respect to Contributions that you       make to a JSR you grant Royalty-Free (RF) licenses a) to your       copyrights and trade-secrets in your contributions and b) for any Essential Patents       (patents &quot;whose infringement cannot be avoided in a technically       feasible manner when implementing the Specification&quot;) related to       your contributions. You can not opt out of your obligation to       license Essential Patents related to your Contributions.<br />
  <br />
You are also obliged to license Essential Patents for all JSRs       even when these patents do not relate to a Contribution that you       make (that is, these could relate to contributions made by others       to a JSR for which you serve on the Expert Group, or to       contributions made by others to a JSR that you have no involvement       with at all). Your obligation in these cases is to license the       patents on FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) rather       than RF terms; in other words, you can charge for the license. You       can opt out of your obligation to license these Essential Patents       if you disclose them before Public Review.</p>
<p>NOTE: The <a href="https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf">IP-flow document</a> we've been working on proposes a change with respect to Essential Patents not related to Contributions for Expert Group members. It says: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Expert Group members make royalty-free grants with respect to       their Essential Patents even as these relate to material       contributed by others. Grants with respect to material that they       did not Contribute may be revoked if they disclose the relevant       patents and withdraw from the Expert Group prior to publication of       the spec for a JCP milestone (eg, Public Review, Proposed Final       Draftâ€¦) If a milestone passes without disclosure and withdrawal       then the EG member is obligated to license Essential Patents that       bear on the spec as it was at that milestone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the remainder of this document I will assume that this proposed change has been put into effect.</p>
<p>  In           summary, there are four distinct IP grants in the current           JSPA:<br />
  <br />
  1) Copyright and trade secrets in Contributions that a           member makes to an EG (whether or not they are a formal member of the                 EG)<br />
  2) Patents that are associated with a           Contribution that a member makes to an EG (whether or not they           are a formal member of the EG)<br />
  3) Essential patents (not associated with a Contribution) that           are related to a JSR for which a member participates in the EG<br />
4) Essential patents (not associated with a Contribution)               that are related to a JSR for which the           member does not participate in the EG</p>
<h3>The <em>strengthened Exhibit B</em><br />
</h3>
<p>Our proposed solution for employed individuals who wish to join         as full members is that their employers should sign a         &quot;strengthened Exhibit B&quot;. (The current Exhibit B simply releases the employee from any obligations he/she may have to assign to the employer IP relevant to a particular JSR; the employer makes no IP commitments at all. Note that the employee's own IP commitments will be defined in the JSPA itself.)</p>
<p>We want this Exhibit B to require the         employer to make IP commitments                   that are comparable to those made by full corporate                   members, but that are different from the commitments                   made by JSPA signatories. (If the IP term were                   identical in the two cases then there would be no                   reason for an employer not to simply join as a                   corporate member.) In addition, we want the                   differences between the Exhibit B and the full JSPA to                   provide an incentive for a corporation to choose                   corporate membership over &quot;sponsoring&quot; its employees                   as individual Full members.<br />
  <br />
We must therefore look for               ways in which we can distinguish between the               strengthened Exhibit B and the full JSPA. Such               distinctions might be in the input (the IP commitment that               the signatory makes) or in the output (the benefits that               they receive in return for their commitments).</p>
<h3>Possible distinctions between Exhibit B and the full JSPA</h3>
<p>During our discussions in the Working Group we considered the following distinctions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exhibit B might require         only a copyright commitment and not a patent commitment. </li>
  <li>Distinguish between RF and (F)RAND commitments.</li>
  <li>Distinguish between the terms of           Essential Patent grants for JSRs where the employee is a           member of the EG and those for &quot;all JSRs&quot;.</li>
  <li>Limit the rights of Exhibit B signatories to declare and withhold Essential Patents.</li>
  <li>Distinguish between the benefits accruing to those who         make IP commitments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A new Exhibit B</h3>
<p>  On the input side, let's consider each of the four separate IP         grants listed above.<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the current JSPA items           1 and 2 require RF commitments for anything that is actively           contributed. I don't believe that we should weaken these           commitments in the new Exhibit B.<br />
    <br />
    For item 3, since we are already proposing a change to the JSPA to make all Essential Patent grants by EG members RF no further distinction can be made between the JSPA and Exhibit B.<br />
    <br />
    For item 4 we might state that only JSPA           signatories incur this obligation. (This would tend to make           the Exhibit B option more attractive than the JSPA option.) For       the record, the other two options in this area are a) no       difference between Exhibit B and the JSPA and b) Exhibit B       signatories must license &quot;all&quot; Essential Patents on RF terms while       JSPA signatories are obliged only to license on FRAND terms. (It's possible that this last suggestion would be so onerous that very few employers       would be willing to sign the strengthened Exhibit B, thereby defeating the whole         purpose.)</p>
  <p>For items 3 and 4 we might distinguish between the right that the patent-owner has to disclose and withhold patent grants. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One         possibility would be to state that if an Exhibit B signatory         declares and withholds an Essential Patent associated       with a JSR for which an employee is a member of the EG then the       employee must withdraw from that EG (no such requirement is or       would be placed on JSPA signatories).</p>
    <p>If we do require Essential Patent grants from Exhibit B       signatories for all JSRs (not just for those where employees are       on the EG) then we could impose a similar penalty here and say       that any withholding of an Essential Patent would require all       employees to withdraw from all all EGs (which would in effect mean       - and perhaps we should enforce this - that all current employee       memberships would be canceled and no employees of that corporation       would be permitted to join in the future). In effect, this would mean that       the only way for such a corporation to withhold a patent would be       to withdraw completely from the JCP.</p>
    <p>To make this distinction even stronger we might prohibit Exhibit B signatories from disclosing and withholding Essential Patents at all unless they (that is, all their employees) withdraw from the JCP.<br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> On the output side we       want to somehow weaken        the benefits that Exhibit B signatories would get in       comparison with JSPA signatories. Since everyone (not just JCP members) gets the right to implement JCP specifications (so long as the implementations are compatible) I'm not sure how to discriminate on the output side of the equation.<br />
</p>
<h3>A proposed new Exhibit B
</h3>
<p>The new Exhibit B should be per-person but not     per-JSR, and should  cover any JSR that the named employee participates     in. This would obligate the employer to make the following IP     commitments:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>RF grants of copyright, trade-secrets, and patents with         respect to Contributions made by the employee.<br />
  </li>
  <li>RF grants with respect to Essential Patents not related to         Contributions for any JSR in which the employee is a member of         the Expert Group. The employer can opt out of this obligation by         disclosing the patent before Public Review, but on doing so the         employee must resign from the Expert Group.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternative #1: if a patent is disclosed and withheld the employee must resign from the JCP.</li>
    
    <li>Alternative #2: if a patent is disclosed and withheld all employees of the organization must resign from the JCP.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>(There would be no obligations with respect to Essential         Patents for JSRs in which the employee is not a member of the         EG.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this is strong enough that we would be satisfied that an       employer was not dodging IP commitments, yet different enough from       the full JSPA that it makes sense for it to exist at all. (Obviously it's weaker in the       sense that there are no obligations for JSRs in which the member       doesn't participate, but I think we can live with that.) </p>
