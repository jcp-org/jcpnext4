## 1.1 JCP Membership

In order to enable the broadest possible participation in the work of the JCP several different roles and membership levels have been defined.

### 1.1.1 Observer

Individuals need not sign a formal JCP Membership Agreement in order to observe and comment on Expert Group activities since they may take advantage of the JCP's transparency mechanisms such as public mailing lists and Issue Trackers. (Typically, however, Observers will need to register at jcp.org and java.net.) Observers are not eligible to join Expert Groups, to run for election to the the Executive Committee, or to vote in the JCP's annual elections.

### 1.1.2 Partner Member

Non-profit organizations such as Java User Groups that are unwilling or unable (because they are not legal entities) to sign the JSPA may sign a simplified Partner Membership Agreement that focuses on the joint promotion of JCP activities in conjunction with JCP Members and staff.

Partner Members cannot act as a Spec Lead or serve on most Expert Groups but they are eligible to run for election to the Executive Committee. If elected, in their role as Executive Committee members they may serve as members of the Expert Group for JSRs whose focus is redefining the JCP's organization and "constitution" by revising its ruling documents. Partner Members have the same voting rights as Full Members.

### 1.1.3 Affiliate Member

An individual who is unwilling or unable to sign the JSPA may sign an Affiliate Membership Agreement in order to participate in the activities of the JCP. (Organizations are ineligible for this class of membership.) The Affiliate Membership Agreement is simpler than the JSPA, and involves a personal IP commitment. No employer signature is required.

Affiliate Members cannot act as a Spec Lead, join an Expert Group, or run for election to the Executive Committee. They are eligible to vote for Community Executive Committee seats but are not not eligible to vote for Ratified or Elected seats. At the Spec Leadâ€™s discretion Affiliate members can be formally recognized by being listed as Contributors to a JSR.

### 1.1.4 Full Member

This class of membership is open to corporations, non-profit organizations that are legal entities, self-employed and unemployed individuals, students, and some employed individuals. The JSPA is the membership agreement for Full Members.

Non-employed individuals and university staff are eligible for Full Membership if they are legally able to license their own IP and can therefore sign the JSPA on their own behalf.

Employed individuals are eligible for Full Membership if their employer is not a Full Member and is willing to sign an Employer Contribution Agreement.

Full members may act as a Spec Lead, join an Expert Group, and run for election to any class of seat on the EC. Full members may vote for Nominated and Elected seats on the EC, but not for Community seats.

#### 1.1.4.1 Member Representative

Employees and other individuals who have a contractual relationship with Full Members may be authorized by the Full Member to represent its interests within the JCP by acting as a Spec Lead, serving on an Expert Group, or running for the EC.
