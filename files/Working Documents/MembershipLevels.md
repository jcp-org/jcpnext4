## Membership levels

### Observer

This role exists today as a result of the JCP.next transparency and participation initiatives.

*   No membership agreement required - just register at jcp.org and possibly java.net.
*   Observers can read and comment on public mailing lists, issue trackers, etc.
*   We have an outstanding proposal to define standard Terms of Use that would apply to all JSR projects.

*   These would cover “casual contributions” from Observers.

*   Observers have no voting rights.

### Partner member

*   New membership class for non-profits (primarily JUGs) that are not legal entities.
*   The Partner membership agreement will focus on the mutual (JCP and JUG) promotion of activities such as Adopt-a-JSR.
*   Partner members cannot act as a Spec Lead or serve on Expert Groups.
*   They can run for election to the EC, and in that role serve on the Expert Group for process-change (JCP.next) JSRs.
*   Individual JUG members must join as Affiliates if they wish to make formal contributions to the work of Expert Groups.
*   Partner members have the same voting rights as Full members.

### Affiliate member

*   New membership class for individuals (corporations and non-profits are ineligible).
*   The JSPA is replaced by a simplified membership agreement that still involves a personal IP commitment.

*   No employer signature is required.

*   Affiliate members cannot act as a Spec Lead, join an Expert Group, or run for EC.
*   Affiliate members can be formally recognized – at the Spec Lead’s discretion – by being listed as Contributors to a JSR.
*   Affiliate members are eligible to vote for two Community EC seats that will be taken from the existing pool of Elected seats.
*   Affiliate members are not eligible to vote for Ratified or Elected EC seats.

### Full member

*   This class of membership is open to corporations, non-profit legal entities, self-employed and unemployed individuals, students, and some employed individuals.
*   The JSPA remains the membership agreement.
*   Full members can act as a Spec Lead, join an Expert Group, and run for a seat on the EC.
*   Full members can vote for Nominated and Elected seats on the EC, but not for Community seats.
*   Non-employed individuals are eligible only if:

*   they can sign the JSPA on their own behalf.
*   they are legally able to directly license their own IP (have not assigned it to another).

*   Employed individuals are eligible only if:

*   their employer is not a Full member.
*   their employer is willing to make a strong IP commitment (similar to commitments made by full members) by signing a strengthened Exhibit B.
*   Exception: university staff can also join as Full members if they meet the conditions specified above for non-employed individuals.

#### Member Representative

*   Employees or staff of Full Members can be Associated with the parent organization's membership if their contractual relationship with the parent is such that they can be legally bound by the parent's IP commitments.
*   Associates can represent their parent organization by acting as a Spec Lead, serving on an Expert Group, or running for the EC.
*   They do not have separate votes: the Full Member has a single vote for EC elections.
